# TurnOnAndBootPC

## Introduction

This project is intended to be a solution to turn on your PC remotely (out of the LAN red) and choose which operating system to boot (in my case Ubuntu or Windows). It uses ESP32 microcontroller board.

The information of emulating an HID with the esp can be found in: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/peripherals/usb/device/tusb_hid/main/tusb_hid_example_main.c
